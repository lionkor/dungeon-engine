# dungeon-engine
A C++ Game Engine for my game, WIP-Title "Dungeon". The entire development process is being live-streamed on [twitch.tv/LeedOff](https://www.twitch.tv/LeedOff).

## Contributing

This project is not under any license. If you'd like to contribute, hop into my livestream or shoot me an [email](mailto:development@kortlepel.com), and we can discuss it. I'm not yet sure whether I want to make the entire game and engine FOSS or just the engine, but I'll gladly hear any input on that :)
